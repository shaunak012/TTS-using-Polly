# AWS Polly Text-to-Speech Service — Project Plan

## 📌 Project Overview  
I am building a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) service using AWS Polly. The service will convert text input into audio output using Amazon Polly’s text-to-speech API, with a Lambda function acting as a bridge.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project?  
I want to explore AWS services beyond theory and build a cloud-based tool that converts any given text into natural-sounding speech. This will improve my understanding of Lambda, Polly, and AWS integration workflows.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Services  
- AWS Lambda  
- Amazon Polly  
- (Optional) Amazon S3 (to store audio files)  
- (Optional) API Gateway (if I want to expose it via HTTP)

---

## 📊 Architecture Overview  
1. User submits text  
2. Lambda function triggers with the text input  
3. Lambda sends the text to Amazon Polly  
4. Polly converts text to audio  
5. Audio returned directly or saved to S3 (optional)

---

## 🕒 Estimated Time  
20-30 minutes to set up the basic working service

---

## 💸 AWS Free Tier Usage  
- Amazon Polly Free Tier: 5 million characters per month (for first 12 months)
- Lambda Free Tier: 1 million requests/month (for first 12 months)

## 📈 Next Steps  
1. ~~Draw architecture diagram~~ 
2. ~~Set up Lambda function~~   
3. ~~Integrate with Polly~~  
4. ~~Test with sample text~~  
5. ~~(Optional) Connect with API Gateway~~   
6. ~~(Optional) Store audio in S3~~  
7. ~~Document the deployment steps~~  
8. ~~Create a LinkedIn post~~
